# C# Operator SDK

The C# Operator SDK implements a framework to build [Kubernetes operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) with C# and .NET Core.

## Usage

In the `/samples/basic` directory you find a [sample operator](./samples/basic/README.md) that simulates the interaction with an external service and can be used as a template for real-world operators. 

[Follow the instructions](./samples/basic/README.md) to run it locally and deploy it to Kubernetes.

## Roadmap

- v1.0.0 (2020 Q4)
    - Retry and auto-recovery on watching and event handling failures
    - [Bookmark event](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#watch-bookmarks) support
